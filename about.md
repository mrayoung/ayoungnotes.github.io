Since the day that I realized that life is getting harder and harder when you are trying hard and it’s easier when you do just little effective thing I have changed my direction. All the thing should be simply action with intelligent decision. After a year as a System engineer and another 3 years working in banking sector in IT field I felt like I want to retire from that responsibility. 

I think I should start learn from new things and trending technology and that’s the time I found myself so in love with blockchain and decentralized.

### People see its as a risk but I see it’s opportunity.

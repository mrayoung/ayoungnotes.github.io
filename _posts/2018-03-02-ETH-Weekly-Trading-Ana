Hey Guys, How may of you are fan of ETH
Per my technical analysis of one month period, ETH price is between 800 to 975 something.

What the matter! If we are break it to weekly trading the potential of growth is a little bit high but not too hight it's could be around the price that I already mentioned. and if its goes down it's should not be lower than 800.

### So what is the position now? 
For those who looking to buy should be patience and wait for next week and if the price hit below 830 it’s should good to buy. So how about those who already holding the ETH for next week you could consider to sell if it’s hit the 900 plus but if it’s reach the 985 USD you still can keep hold for more profit.

Oh! wait read this guys
